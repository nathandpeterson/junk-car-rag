Stop racing, pay attention to your surroundings and the situation ahead, and proceed in single file at a reasonable pace. BE SURE YOU’RE IN SINGLE FILE AND WELL BELOW RACING SPEED BY THE TIME YOU REACH THE STATION! Remain in single file at a reasonable pace until you are safely past the incident.\nRed: Stop Immediately\nOn red, come to a safe, controlled stop as soon as practical. Something has happened that requires all the track resources to resolve before racing can continue. Pull to the outside edge of the pavement in view of a flag station and wait for more instructions.\nWhite: Slow Vehicle(s) On Track\nA safety vehicle or crapping-out racecar is ahead. WATCH OUT! You may pass it, but only when safe and at a reasonable speed. All other flags still apply. Remember: There may be more than one vehicle to watch out for.\nBlack (pointed at you individually): You’ve Got Problems\nFor an individual black, come to the Penalty Box immediately—either you’ve got a mechanical problem, or you/your team has committed a punishment-worthy sin.\nBlack (waving at all stations): We’ve All Got Problems\nFor “black all,” exit at your next opportunity, go back to your paddock space, and wait for more instructions.\nRed & Yellow Stripes: Surface Problems\na.k.a. the Ronald McDonald flag—something iffy is down on the track surface—could be water, could be oil, could be a ’73 Fiat cylinder head. NOTE: After a few laps the surface flag may disappear, even though the surface problem has not. Continue to use caution after the surface flag goes away.\nBlue w/ Yellow Stripe: You Suck\nBlue and yellow means there’s faster traffic behind you, like you didn’t know that already. (This is just informational. You’re welcome to say “who the $*#& cares?” It ain’t your job to solve the other guy’s problem.)",
